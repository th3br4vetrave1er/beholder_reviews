# **👁️ Beholder Reviews – Summon the All-Seeing Demon of Cinema 🎬🔥**  

**"Mortal, you dare seek knowledge of the forbidden films? Summon me, the Beholder, and gaze upon the truth! But beware… for not all movies are worthy of my gaze!"**  

Beholder Reviews is a **console-based movie search tool** powered by the **TMDb API**. The ancient Beholder will scan the vast archives of human cinema and **reveal hidden truths** – movie ratings, descriptions, release years, genres, and even a glimpse of the sacred movie poster.  

## **🛠 Features**  
✅ Summon the Beholder to seek knowledge of any movie  
✅ Retrieve IMDb rating, year, and description  
✅ View a sacred portrait (poster) of the film  
✅ Handle errors if no film is found – the Beholder despises foolish questions  
✅ Exit the ritual safely before the Beholder consumes your soul

## **👁️ The True Beholder – Not Just an Eyed Abomination!**  
The Beholder is **a legendary aberration**, a floating nightmare of **pure intellect and malice**. Not to be confused with lesser eye-creatures, the Beholder is a master manipulator and destroyer. Each of its **many eyes** fires a **different deadly ray** – from petrification to disintegration.   

In the world of Dungeons & Dragons, **a single Beholder rules over its domain, fearing only one thing – other Beholders**. Their paranoia and **obsession with perfection** make them formidable foes, driven by **an unmatched thirst for control and knowledge**.  

In Beholder Reviews, this **omniscient entity** now turns its gaze upon cinema – for even the Beholder must know which films are truly legendary… and which are unworthy!
